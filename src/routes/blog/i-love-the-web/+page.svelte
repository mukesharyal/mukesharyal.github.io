                    The image shows the map of the undersea network that carries the internet. Our network traffic, mostly made of cat 
                    vidoes on Twitter, make their way through these cables, spanning continents.

                    We kind of assume that our social media feeds and our text messages and whatever are meta physical, and just
                    "appear" out of thin air. But they are as physical as it gets, just like any other technology. This depiction makes
                    us realise that we are all physically connected enabling us to express ourselves and tell our unique stories.

                    The Humble Beginnings
                </h1>

                <p>
                    According to the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/">
                    The Internet Society</a>, the concept of a massive network of computing devices scattered throughout the world
                    was just a concept in 1962. That was around 60 years ago! J.C.R. Licklider from MIT wrote a series of memos
                    envisioning a "Galactic Network" of computing devices through which "everyone could quickly access data and
                    programs from any site". It was just a concept note 60 years ago, and today, every field touched by humanity
                    from medicine to finance depends on it.<sup><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/">[1]</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The ARPANET program, initiated by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was the starting point
                    of the internet to which the first ever node connected was from Network Measurement Center at UCLA in September
                    1969. Stanford Research Institute soon joined as the second node. Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara
                    and University of Utah. As a result, by the end of 1969, four host computers were connected together into the
                    network.<sup><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/">[2]</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the following years, more and more computers were connected to the ARPANET program. In October 1972,
                    the first public demonstration of the ARPANET was made at the International Computer Communication Conference (ICCC).
                    And it did not take long before it grew and grew into the internet as we know of it today.<sup><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/">[3]</a></sup>

                <h1>
                    Let's Get On The Internet!
                </h1>

                <p>
                    When Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, all the documents and programs scattered around found their 
                    presence on the internet. It was now not just for the science guys with glasses but for everyone. It was made available
                    for the general public around 1993 and everybody swarmed on the internet with desires to tell their stories. Most 
                    of the websites of the time were made of static content like text and images and hyperlinks connecting the pages
                    with one another.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Interactivity was introduced to the web after Brendan Eich developed the JavaScript language while working for Netscape,
                    the company behind Netscape Navigator, the most popular web browser of the time. By the early 2000s, technologies like
                    PHP, AJAX and web frameworks were developed amplifying the speed of web development. When everyone was on the internet,
                    it was a no-brainer for the companies to have their presence in the web as well.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">[4]</a></sup>

                <h1>
                    The Dot Com Bubble
                </h1>

                <p>
                    As people had realised that the internet was a force to reckon with, the investors were keen to ride the wave of the new 
                    technology. At the same time, the number of people willing to be on the internet was increasing. Between 1990 and 1997,
                    the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35%.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#cite_note-14">[5]</a></sup>
                    And with that percentage grew the willingness of people to be on the internet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Adding to this, economists claim that the economy was at the right time to fuel the fundings as well. Due to lower interest 
                    rates, funding became easier. As a result, investors were willing to put heavy amount of investments in any business that 
                    had an internet presence and the infamous ".com" suffix in their names. People to this day talk about the pets.com company
                    that had a huge investment funding when it became one of the biggest victims of the eventual "pop"!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While most of the internet businesses that had nothing to do with the internet failed, some players came out of the 
                    bubble largely unaffected. They went on to become the big tech of the Silicon Valley. Some of those survivors were Apple, 
                    Amazon, Google and Microsoft. They survived the bubble because they <strong>were</strong> internet companies unlike the majority.

                <h1>
                    Steve Jobs And The iPhone
                </h1>

                <p>
                    While the internet was ever growing in popularity and more and more companies were creating products for the web, 
                    most of the products were for desktop computers. The cellphones of the time were not "smart" and were only used 
                    for making phone calls. That was all about to change when Steve Jobs went onto the stage on June 29, 2007 to unveil the 
                    iPhone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the iPhone, a million smart handheld devices capable of surfing the web were in the hands of customers in mere 
                    months.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)#cite_note-45">[6]</a></sup> The popularity of smartphones grew exponentially in the initial years and more and more smartphones were being used 
                    to connect people on the web. Smartphone operating systems and their app stores became popular to create better apps 
                    and experiences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though people download apps, the underlying web technologies remain the same. Also, more people rely on the internet 
                    for information and education than ever. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube have billions of users using 
                    their platforms each month. News web portals amass millions of visits each day with most of the users coming via smartphones.

                    The Rise Of Internet Services
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Internet has become an inseparable part of our daily lives. We start our day with social media feeds. We find and order 
                    groceries via the internet. We find our daily commute route via internet mapping technologies. We collaborate together 
                    at work through productivity suites created by tech companies. We connect with our loved ones via social apps. We take 
                    online courses for skills we want to work on via web platforms.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our dependence on the internet has made tech industry a large industry supporting the economy. During global emergency 
                    like the Covid 19 pandemic, the internet services were the only means to learn, work, connect and get information. Digital 
                    products, unlike physical products can be replicated almost indefinitely which makes the software industry have big margins 
                    on the products they create.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a result of large returns, the software industry has been a go-to for new generations to join the workforce. University 
                    degrees like Software Engineering and Computer Science see double or treble the enrollments compared to other degrees. Well, 
                    that was the trend for years lately until this new wave of technology has been the new talking point: AI.

                    AI Slop
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Generative AI is the new hottest thing in the tech space with large language model chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini 
                    being at the centre of the attention. While the promise of them being able to replace much of the human workforce 
                    in work environments hasn't panned out as expected, they <strong>have</strong> had a great effect in one thing for sure: 
                    The Internet. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    People make money on the internet by making valuable content and using adverts to account for monetization. Since the 
                    article or the blog post or the video provides value to the user, they do not mind the adverts (as long as they are not 
                    too distracting, of course!) and just focus on the content. That had been working up until these "generative" technologies 
                    with the capability of "generation" arrived.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It hasn't been easier to create content on the web using these generative technologies. While the quality of the content 
                    is below par, the quantity of the output that can be generated can't be ignored at all! While a blogger spends hours and days 
                    to craft a beautiful blog post, the generative AI can spit out tens of blogs in one prompt. With these even crazier things 
                    like AI agents, they can keep posting these blog posts about topics they deem useful <strong>forever</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We, the dwellers of the internet, love to hate these things and call them by a beautiful and representing name: AI Slop. 
                    They have been spreading their thousand arms into every caverns and crevises of the web and just a couple of days ago, they 
                    have made a major milestone: AI generated content just surpassed the human generated content on the internet.<sup><a href="https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans">[7]</a></sup>

                    Going Forward
                </h1>

                <p>
                    To be honest, much of this doesn't surprise me at all. Greed is one of the dominating human emotions and it gets the 
                    better of us most of the times. When people realise that they can make a quick couple of bucks without actually doing the 
                    work, they will try their luck in it. Makes sense. Can't blame them for that. Forgery and fraud and scams have 
                    always been a part of the internet along with the good it brings. Now, it's just harder to pick them out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Along with scaring the content creators, the slop has also given some hope to them. Now, the people consuming content appreciate 
                    the hard work that goes into the process even more. The actual human buddies creating value out of their content are cherished 
                    even more. The diamonds get to sparkle even brighter among the dull coal surrounding it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The damage has been done, is being done and we just have to live with it. The internet has more content than ever but 
                    requires more digging to extract the gold out of it. Now, we will have to label the gold mines apart from the others. People 
                    are more internet literate than ever and they will figure a way out! They will figure out a way to keep their quest for
                    knowlegde and connections going. Human perseverance has always triumphed and will continue to do so. Until next time! 👋
